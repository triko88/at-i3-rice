# Apan Trikha's i3 Rice
These are basically my config files I've used to setup my i3 Window Manager on Arch Linux.
All of these files are in solarized color scheme to reduce eye-strain and work on my laptop for long hours. So even if you want to work late at night, this will get you covered.
So, programs I use configured are:

* Termite Terminal Emulator
* Polybar
* Fish shell
* Neofetch 
* NeoVim
* Powerline Shell
